  # Germinator Project Context
  
  Germinator is a configuration adapter for AI coding assistant documents.
  
  ## Architecture
  - Models: internal/models/ - Platform-agnostic data structures
  - Core: internal/core/ - Parser, loader, serializer
  - Services: internal/services/ - Validation, transformation
  - CLI: cmd/ - Cobra-based command line interface
  
  ## Key Principles
  - Single source of truth: Germinator YAML format
  - Platform-agnostic models with all fields
  - Template-based serialization
  - Unidirectional transformation: Germinator → target platform
