context: |
  Domain: Configuration adapter transforming AI coding assistant documents (commands, memory, skills, agents) between platforms. Claude Code document standard as source format.``
  
  Tech stack: Go 1.25.5, Cobra CLI, JSON Schema (xeipuuv/gojsonschema)
  Tooling: mise, golangci-lint
  
  Code conventions:
  - NO comments in code unless explicitly requested
  - Use mise run <task> for all task operations
  - Run mise run check before committing
  
  Architecture patterns:
  - No predefined directory structure (CLI works with any input/output paths)
  - Platform differences handled automatically via adapters
  - Preserve source content, only adapt for target compatibility
  - No forced compatibility - omit unsupported features gracefully
  
  Testing: Table-driven tests with fixtures
  
  Research documentation (openspec/research/):
  - Purpose: Factual reference for AI agents understanding platform-specific features
  - Usage: Consult when building/adapting platform adapters or validating configurations
  - Notes: Documents are concise overviews, not implementation guidance

  Spec organization:
  - specs/models/ - Core data structures
  - specs/documents/ - Document lifecycle
  - specs/transformation/ - Platform conversion
  - specs/quality/ - Code quality enforcement
  - specs/infrastructure/ - Infrastructure support and meta-specifications

  Delta specs use the same nested structure as main specs. When a change is synced, delta spec paths determine where main specs are updated.

rules:
  proposal:
    - Focus on "Why", "What Changes", "Capabilities", "Impact"
    - List all files affected by change
    - Document new/modified capabilities with clear descriptions
  
  specs:
    - Use Given/When/Then/AND scenario format
    - Each scenario should be testable
  
  design:
    - Include technical decisions and rationale
    - Document tradeoffs explicitly
  
  tasks:
    - Break into small, clear, logically ordered steps
    - Include verification steps (mise run check, lint, test)
